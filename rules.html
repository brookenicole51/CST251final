<div class="info">
<p>The 2020 season of major league baseball was a historic season. COVID-19 on the rise and strict guidelines in place across the country the MLB needed to make changes to keep players safe. One of the major changes was how rules were changed in order to help keep players changed. Some of the things that change the way the game is played can subsequently change the safety of the teams. Some of these rule changes include having a universal designated hitter, runner on second to start extra innings, position players pitching, suspended games, unsportsmanlike conduct and the wet rag rule.</p>
<p>While these changes may not seem like they affect COVID they in fact do. For example, having a player start on second would help to speed up the game in order to make games shorter and have players together for a shorter period of time. There were some other off field protocols the MLB implemented including, players not being in the dugout if not playing, catchers staying out of the batter's box while giving signs, players can not socialize with the other team before play. One big part of the changes was that the season was only 60 games as opposed to the usual 162. Cutting the season down so small was a big decision meant to keep players in contact with each other for as short of time as possible. Also teams had to submit active rosters of 28 players to keep the number of people in that are together as slim as possible. Overall, there were tons of changes that affected this season but they definitely helped to keep players safe. The MLB had low numbers of players who got COVID and very few cancelled games due to COVID.</p>
