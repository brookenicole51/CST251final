<div class="info">
<p>For the MLB, baseball is more than just a sport. It is a multi-billion dollar business that relies
	 on the fanâ€™s devotion and viewer participation in order to be successful. With COVID-19 hitting our
	  country earlier this year, the MLB had to make major changes in order to continue the season without
		losing money. One of the first major changes was the shortening of the 2020 season. With only 60 games
		 to play, the league lost tons of viewership and attendance money on the other 100 games that would have
		  played out. Another major impact was the absence of fans, which was a huge impact since no tickets were
			being sold. Stadiums felt dead and empty, and players even commented on how weird it was to not have a
			cheering crowd. TV networks had little to no content to film besides the game itself, and the overall
			mood of the arenas was not the same. The financial impact of COVID-19 differs from team to team,
			however. Since most players are signed under a contract, many new rules and regulations were put
			in place to make sure players were paid fairly. Many contracts were changed, extended, and cut because
			of the virus, and it definitely affected every player financially. This year has been a challenge for many sports,
			 but the MLB has been lucky enough to complete the 2020 season (somewhat) safely. Even though the financial side of
			 the MLB took a massive hit, that does not change the fact that thousands of fans will hopefully return to the field
			 next season to support their beloved baseball teams.
