<div class="info">
<p> Just as the 2020 regular season was drastically changed, the postseason went through some major format rule changes. Normally a MLB postseason would consist of 10 teams competing for the title. However, this year they allowed 16 teams, 8 from the American League, 8 from the National League. To put the bracket into simple terms, they allowed teams who would normally not have made the postseason in the past to make it. They would then face the best teams allowing for more upset and chances for the bad teams as wildcard games would be a 3 game series rather than a 1 game playoff matchup which has always been. When all added up there would be 4 rounds to be played while in the past most teams would only have to 3.</p>

<p> Unlike the NBA, the league was not played in a completely isolated “bubble.” However all games after the Wildcard Series would be played on the Westcoast. The American League Division Series (ALDS) would be played in San Diego and Los Angeles while the National League Division Series (NLDS)  would be played in Arlington and Huston. The American League Championship Series (ALCS) would be in San Diego and the National League Championship Series (NLCS) would be in Arlington. Finally the World Series would be played in Arlington. The Dodgers, having the best major league record, would have home field advantage in Los Angeles in the first round and then for the rest of the postseason would play in Arlington.</p>

<p>This gave them an advantage because they did less traveling and got used to their new home ballpark before the opposing team in the World Series would even play a game in that ballpark. It is also worth noting that there will be no off-days in the middle of the Wild Card Series, Division Series and League Championship Series rounds. In the past, there would be off days every to three games to give teams time to travel to the opposing team’s ballpark. Since the NLCS and World Series was held in Arlington Texas, the COVID laws have changed because of state laws. This meant that fans were allowed to attend the NLCS and World Series at limited capacity.</p>

<p>Lastly, there were some minor rule changes for the postseason. During the regular season, just for this year, extra innings (overtime to resolve a tie game) would have a runner be placed at second base for more opportunity to score runs. For the 2020 postseason, this rule would be eliminated making it how baseball has always been played. Other than that, roster sizes will remain the same size (28 players), there will be a National League Designated hitter (in past years they don’t use one, 2020 they did). Furthermore, the three-batter-minimum (a rule requiring relief pitchers to come into the game and face at least three batters) will be continued into the postseason. In the end, the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Tampa Rays to win their first World Series Championship since 1988.</p>
