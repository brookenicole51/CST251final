<p> For all those who enjoy the game of baseball it changed in the year of 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Major League Baseball Season had a season like never before. MLB fan bases could only support their favorite teams from over a screen. With all MLB ballparks prohibiting fans inside it wasn’t the first time this happened. In recent history of the MLB there was a game played with no fans on April 29, 2015, when the Orioles played the White Sox in Baltimore. However, this was because of civil unrest from police brutality which resulted in the death of Freddie Gray; a 25-year-old black male from Baltimore. Fast forward to 2020 and the reason ballparks are empty is because of Coronavirus.
</p>

<p> When MLB the season started on July 23, 2020 ballpark seats were filled with cardboard cutouts of people, virtual crowds for broadcast, and artificial noise. For the first time, this was implemented into the gameplay of Major League Baseball. With the lack of real individuals in the stands you can infer there was an impact not only on fans, but also owners and players from fans not being in attendance. There is no question; owners of these Major League Baseball teams have certainly lost money. A fanless ballpark will take away the income that’s normally gained through ticket sales to fans; alongside the sales from concessions through food and apparel. Closing off the ballpark from fans also changes how players think. As a Major League Baseball player it’s nothing like performing in front of your home crowd. Without fans attending the games the rush of adrenaline changes. Without the roaring, cheering, and interactions of fans; players have to be self-motivated and stay mentally focused with the unique change to the game they play. In 2020 for fans the experience of a baseball game in person had to come to a halt. In the near future we will see if fans are able to see they’re favorite teams and players in person without having to sweat the coronavirus.
