<p>This website will cover the impact COVID on the 2020 MLB season and will cover 5 subtopics. The website will be very informational and will summarize all the things that went into this crazy season. The website will be very simple and easy to read. The impact COVID had on the 2020 MLB season was detrimental to the players, organizations, and the entertainment factor being that fans were unable to attend games of the regular season. In this informational webpage we will be looking at the exact impacts COVID had on baseball in the unprecedented season. Subtopics will include: Impact on players, Impact on Rules, Impact on Fans, Financial Impact, and Impact on Postseason. Some many things were impacted within these subtopics and we will be exploring how the league responded by answering the questions laid out in the prototype. While the short season may impact player's stats for better or for worse, we will not look too much into players statistical changes compared to a regular season since it is impossible to know whether this type of season helped or hurt a player's performance. </p>
