	<div class="info">

	<p> At the beginning of the 2020 MLB season the only thing that was certain for the future of games was the uncertainty of it.
	While past seasons usually began in mid-March and included around a total of 160 games, the 2020 season did not begin until late July and only had 60 games in total for the whole season.
	Major League Baseball players dedicated their whole life to get to this moment in their baseball careers only for it to get torn away from them. With the loss of games also comes the loss of money for the players. A study
	found that, “ MLB players may have taken a substantial hit of $79,370,548 due to player absences, as at least 30 players and 11 umpires have taken injury time off or opted out of
	the current season due to the pandemic” (CalvinArye). The most relevant reason for this impact financially was the 15 players who opted out of the season, which totals to about $78.1 million dollars.
	As most people had their social lives completely taken away all professional athletes had to go through isolated quarantine, and a series of Covid-19 tests weekly. </p>
